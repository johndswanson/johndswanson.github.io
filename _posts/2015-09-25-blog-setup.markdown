**On choosing a blogging platform and setting up a no-nonsense blog.**

When I decided to begin this endeavor, I almost decided not to blog the experience.  I don't enjoy narrative writing outside incident reports; it reminds me too much of my B.A. in Political Science.  I'm also not a fan of most blogging platforms.  Finding one that is a balance of ease of use, feature completeness, security (looking at you, Wordpress), and cost effectiveness can be a challenge.

I'm a big fan of clean and simple blogs.  Brian Warehime's [Nullsecure.org](http://nullsecure.org/) is a prime example of what I like in a blog and served in large part as inspiration for this one.  So initially I looked at the platform he chose, [Ghost](https://ghost.org/).  Ghost is quite polished and preaches simplicity.  It also seemed great from a feature standpoint, but as I dug in, it looked like many of the benefits were derived by subscribing as a Pro member, for $8/month.  I'm a public sector employee working in education; needless to say, I don't make a ton of money, so the idea of spending monthly just to host a blog didn't sound appealing.  I'd rather spend what I can on technical resources.  Ghost does allow self-hosting for free, with fewer features, but I decided against that due to added complexity and a clunkier install process.

At that point, I went on the standard blog tour of many of the common names in the business such as Blogger and Wordpress, as well as some newer options like Medium.  Ultimately, I stumbled into [Tinypress](https://tinypress.co).
