**On choosing a blogging platform and setting up a no-nonsense blog.**

When I decided to begin this endeavor, I almost decided not to blog the experience.  I don't enjoy narrative writing outside incident reports; it reminds me too much of my B.A. in Political Science.  I'm also not a fan of most blogging platforms.  Finding one that is a balance of ease of use, feature completeness, security (looking at you, Wordpress), and cost effectiveness can be a challenge.

I'm a big fan of clean and simple blogs.  Brian Warehime's [Nullsecure.org](http://nullsecure.org/) is a prime example in what I like in a blog and served in large part as inspiration for this one.  So initially I looked at the platform he chose, [Ghost](https://ghost.org/).
