# The Rise and Fall of an Empire

Angler, and to a lesser extent, Nuclear, were the predominant exploit kits (EKs) of 2015 and the first half of 2016 before suddenly disappearing early last summer.  With plenty of money to be made on the distribution of ransomware and banking trojans, other EKs quickly filled the void.  Neutrino and RIG were the first to respond, though Neutrino itself disappeared in September of 2016.

Around the same time, Empire, a privately-sold EK with roots in the more widely-available RIG kit, appeared on the scene, ostensibly to steal a piece of the crimeware pie.  Sometimes referred to as RIG-E, Empire delivered a wide variety of payloads during the fall of 2016, including [custom ransomware](http://www.broadanalysis.com/2016/12/20/2613/) and [banking trojans](http://www.broadanalysis.com/2016/12/09/compromised-sites-rig-e-and-rig-v-exploit-kits-deliver-cerber-chthonic-gootkit/).  According to Brad Duncan over at [Malware-Traffic-Analysis](http://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2016/12/21/index2.html) and Palo Alto Unit42, Empire was often utilized by the [EITest](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/10/unit42-eitest-campaign-evolution-angler-ek-neutrino-rig/) campaign, which had previously utilized Angler in great quantities.

Unfortunately for the purveyors of Empire, and fortunately for the rest of us, Empire's reign was short-lived.  Like its predecessors Angler, Nuclear, and Neutrino, Empire itself mysteriously disappeared at the end of December 2016.

# Nebula Appears

While Empire enjoyed only a short period in the sun, RIG itself continues to operate successfully as does Sundown, another exploit kit seeing success in the wake of Angler.  Additionally, it seems a new contender has appeared, seeking to take up the slack left by Empire.  Seemingly a hybrid of Sundown and Empire, Nebula, first appearing for sale on February 17th, integrated an internal traffic direction system (TDS) seemingly salvaged from the ashes of Empire.  For more information, check out Kafeine's excellent post [here](http://malware.dontneedcoffee.com/2017/03/nebula-exploit-kit.html).

As a long-overdue exercise in crimeware analysis using OSINT, I decided to take a crack at examining the Nebula EK infrastructure in an attempt to better understand the actors utilizing it and the payloads being delivered.  What I found was both amusing and unexpected for an exploit kit so new to the scene.

# Tools of the Trade

All of the tools I use to perform this analysis are available either completely free of charge or as full-featured community editions.  For visual analysis, I use Paterva [Maltego](https://www.paterva.com/web7/buy/maltego-clients/maltego-ce.php).  As data sources used to expand on and add context to the blogs of Kafeine and Brad Duncan mentioned above, I use [ThreatCrowd](https://www.threatcrowd.org/), [ThreatMiner](https://www.threatminer.org/), [Alienvault OTX](https://otx.alienvault.com/), and RiskIQ's [PassiveTotal](https://passivetotal.org/).  All of these offer transforms for Maltego either directly or via other community members.

# Brian Krebs: EK Peddler

Analysis begins with a single Nebula EK delivery subdomain provided by Brad Duncan's [analysis](http://malware-traffic-analysis.net/2017/03/02/index.html) of a recent Nebula infection chain: ehpcc.chggannel[.]stream.  As a starting point, I dropped the subdomain into PassiveTotal:

![Nebula1](https://swannysec.net/public/Nebula1.jpg)

Clearly, the subdomain is brand new, having been first seen (and in fact, last seen) on March 2nd, resolving to a Worldstream IP out of the Netherlands.  We'll come back to the IP and the rest of the chggannel domain in a moment.  What immediately proved far more interesting to me was the whois record for the domain.  Whois pivoting is not always reliable, nor is it always even possible, depending on the registrar used and the OPSEC practices of the actor.  Fortunately, in this case, the actors gave us something to work with.

![Nebula2](https://swannysec.net/public/Nebula2.jpg)

So it seems Brian Krebs has turned to a life of crime and is now a member of the Yugoslavian Business Network?  As amusing and unlikely as that is, we likely have a couple of interesting indicators to work from, including a whois name, e-mail, org, and perhaps a phone number.  PassiveTotal is a fantastic source for this kind of data and we should be able to pivot on those indicators to learn more, provided the actors have used them with any consistency.  Before we move to Maltego and continue exploring, let's check out the rest of that domain.  Looks like there are two other subdomains here, giving us a good starting point to work from:

![Nebula3](https://swannysec.net/public/Nebula3.jpg)

We'll go ahead and drop the domain into Maltego and add in the other Nebula domains provided by Brad Duncan's post.  As a first step, we'll pull in the whois details for all four domains to see whether or not we have consistent indicators to work with:

![Nebula4](https://swannysec.net/public/Nebula4.jpg)

Sure enough, we've definitely got consistent use of the same data for the whois records.

![Nebula5](https://swannysec.net/public/Nebula5.jpg)

Quickly pivoting through the registrant name, e-mail, org name, and phone number in PassiveTotal show that the e-mail and phone number have the most consistency, as there are obviously some legitimate domains registered by real people named Brian Krebs.  There are an identical 114 domains registered with the nista@pusikurac[.]com e-mail adress and the same phone number.  We'll go ahead and pivot inside Maltego off the e-mail and pull back all the domains PassiveTotal knows about registered with that address.

![Nebula6](https://swannysec.net/public/Nebula6.jpg)

![Nebula7](https://swannysec.net/public/Nebula7.jpg)

Pivoting from these new domains to their IPs by pulling the Passive DNS results from PassiveTotal brings back a whopping one IP.  Why?  Mr. Krebs seems to be making extensive use of subdomains.  The second screenshot shows what happens when we pull in all the subdomains for the domains present, the entity count of the graph nearly triples.

![Nebula8](https://swannysec.net/public/Nebula8.jpg)

![Nebula9](https://swannysec.net/public/Nebula9.jpg)

Once more pulling in the IPs via Passive DNS, we see that 300+ domains and subdomains return to only fourteen IPs, in the red-orange color.  It should be noted that a few of these IPs are shared webhosts and that the legitimate domains are not displayed on this graph.

![Nebula10](https://swannysec.net/public/Nebula10.jpg)

Unfortunately, ThreatCrowd, ThreatMiner, and Alientvault OTX all return no results when I attempt to query for malware samples observed at the domains registered by this actor.  Further, none of the domains or subdomains host SSL certificates according to PassiveTotal.  Accordingly, we'll wrap up our pivoting here, having exhausted the unique whois indicators provided by the Nebula actors.

# Nebula's Extent and Payloads

In order to clean up the graph and ensure all the data is likely relevant to Nebula, we want to take a look at the registrations from a temporal perspective.  Of the 114 domains registered using the farcical Brian Krebs moniker and nista@pusikurac[.]com at the time of writing, 12 were registered in May of 2016.  All 12 of these domains were also registered under a different whois org name, `ISP`.  Since February 8th, 2017, 102 domains have been registered under the Krebs/nista@pusikurac[.]com combination, of which 97 used Yugoslavian Business Network as their org name.  Curiously, however, the 12 domains registered earlier have active subdomains observed during the recent Nebula campaign.

Little additional information can be gleaned from the OSINT sources I have available to me, but from the analyses performed by Kafeine and Brad Duncan, we know that Nebula leads to a variety of payloads including [DiamondFox](https://www.cylance.com/a-study-in-bots-diamondfox), [Gootkit](https://securelist.com/blog/research/76433/inside-the-gootkit-cc-server/), [Ramnit](https://securityintelligence.com/ramnit-rears-its-ugly-head-again-targets-major-uk-banks/), and [Pitou](https://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002738.html).  With the exception of Pitou, which is a spambot, all of these are bankers.  At this time, there is no evidence the Yugoslavian Business Network actors are distributing ransomware via Nebula.

# Conclusions

The Yugoslavian Business Network actually has a significant history with the Sundown EK.  According to Ed Miles at [Zscaler](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/sundown-chronicles-observations-exploit-kits-evolution), the first indications of Yugoslavian Business Network involvement with Sundown began in July of 2016.  At this time, however, it was unclear how the group, which advertised their coding services in German on forums, was associated with Sundown.  By September, [Trustwave](https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/SpiderLabs-Blog/Sundown-EK-%E2%80%93-Stealing-Its-Way-to-the-Top/) indicated that the Sundown actors had "outsourced" their DGA work to the Yugoslavian Business Network.  By the end of October 2016, Nick Biasini at Cisco's Talos Intelligence [concluded](http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2016/10/sundown-ek.html) that Yugoslavian Business Network indicators were associated with all Sundown landing pages and that Sundown's actors were operating a very large domain shadowing and wildcarding operation to power the exploit kit's spread.  Interestingly, he also concluded that the payloads from this operation were exclusively banking trojans.

Given the close historical ties between Sundown and the Yugoslavian Business Network, it is probable that Nebula is simply a new iteration on the existing Sundown exploit kit, operated by the same actors or a closely related group of actors.  The willingness of the Yugoslavian Business Network to flaunt their moniker throughout their involvement with Sundown squares with the appearance of that name in the whois records for the Nebula campaign.  Additionally, two other calling cards of the YBN appear to be present in the Nebula campaign, the use of subdomains/domain wildcarding and the almost exclusive delivery of banking malware vs. ransomware.  Finally, the gang at Digital Shadows has additional [details](https://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/sun-to-set-on-bepssundown-exploit-kit/), including tweets from @CryptoInsane and @666_KingCobra (the alleged author of the Terror exploit kit) which seem to indicate that the Nebula source code offered for sale is in fact that of Sundown.

As an alternative hypothesis, it is possible that the Nebula activity I have analyzed here is indicative of a copycat operation, designed to look like the Sundown/YBN activity using the leaked source code.  However, I believe that the balance of the evidence supports the original conclusion and that this is probably not a copycat operation.

In a follow-up to this post, I will be detailing the process of using PassiveTotal to set up a public project and the monitor function to track the YBN actor and Nebula campaign.  IOCs are provided below.  As always, I invite comment, debate, or criticism [@swannysec](https://twitter.com/swannysec).
